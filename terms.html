    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the FinScope mobile application (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Nature of the Service (Manual Tracking)</h2>
    <p>FinScope is strictly a <strong>manual portfolio analytics tool</strong>. It does not connect to brokerage accounts, banks, or live market data feeds. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data (tickers, prices, quantities, dates) is manually entered by you.</li>
        <li>The Service does not verify the accuracy of your input.</li>
        <li>You may use the Service for hypothetical scenarios ("mock data") or real tracking at your own discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Disclaimer: No Financial Advice</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The Service is for informational purposes only. We do not provide investment, legal, or tax advice.
    </div>
    <p>Any analytical outputs (e.g., "Net Return," "Unrealized P/L") are estimates based solely on the data you provide. We are not responsible for financial decisions made based on these calculations.</p>

    <h2>3. Calculation Limitations</h2>
    <p>The analytics provided by FinScope are simplified estimates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> We do not account for capital gains tax, wash sales, or specific tax lots (FIFO/LIFO) relevant to your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Unless manually adjusted by you in the "Unit Price," transaction fees and commissions may not be reflected.</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Currency conversions are estimates based on the rates or values you input.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Account Security & No Recovery</h2>
    <p>To protect your privacy, we collect minimal data. As a result, <strong>we do not offer an automated password reset feature via email.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are solely responsible for remembering your username and password.</li>
        <li><strong>If you lose your credentials, you will permanently lose access to your account and data.</strong> We cannot restore access because we do not verify user identity.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping your device secure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions (Freemium)</h2>
    <p>FinScope offers a free tier and a paid "Premium" subscription, managed via Apple's App Store.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your App Store Account Settings. We cannot cancel subscriptions or issue refunds directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice, if you breach these Terms. You may also delete your account at any time via the in-app settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall FinScope, its developers, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including loss of data or funds) arising from your use of the Service or reliance on its analytics.</p>

    <h2>8. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. Specifically, you agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the app.</li>
        <li>Use the Service to transmit malware, viruses, or harmful code.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our backend systems or API.</li>
        <li>Interfere with the integrity or performance of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Turkey, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
