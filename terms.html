    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms carefully before using the FinScope app.</p>

    <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
    <p>FinScope is a <strong>manual portfolio analytics tool</strong>. It relies entirely on data input by the user (prices, quantities, dates). The app does not pull real-time market data from any exchange or brokerage. You acknowledge that you can enter mock data, historical data, or estimates, and the app's output will reflect only what you have input.</p>

    <h2>2. Disclaimer: No Financial or Tax Advice</h2>
    <p><strong>The analytical solutions provided by the app are estimates for informational purposes only.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The app does not account for specific tax laws, fees, or regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Profit/Loss calculations are based on simple mathematical formulas using your provided data.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for any financial decisions or losses made based on data from this app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions (Freemium)</h2>
    <p>FinScope offers a free tier with limitations and a Premium subscription managed via Apple's App Store (RevenueCat).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Account Security</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. We currently do not offer an automated password reset feature via email. It is your responsibility to remember your credentials.</p>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice, for any conduct that we believe violates these Terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall FinScope, nor its developers, be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of your use of the service or reliance on the analytics provided.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at <strong>support@finscope.app</strong>.</p>
