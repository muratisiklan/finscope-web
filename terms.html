    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the Portfoyo mobile application (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use this Service. By using Portfoyo, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>

    <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
    <p>Portfoyo is a <strong>manual portfolio analytics tool</strong>. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Data is Manual:</strong> We do not connect to your bank accounts, brokerage accounts, or private wallets. All asset quantities and buy prices are manually entered by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Only:</strong> The Service provides analytical tools to visualize the distribution and performance of the data you enter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Exchange Rates & Asset Conversion</h2>
    <p>The Service utilizes public third-party APIs (including <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>CoinGecko</strong>, and <strong>Frankfurter</strong>) strictly for the purpose of <strong>currency conversion</strong> and <strong>asset normalization</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversion Utility:</strong> We do not display raw market data feeds. We use these providers solely to calculate the exchange rate between your assets (e.g., Gold, Crypto, USD) and your selected display currency (e.g., TRY).</li>
        <li><strong>Synthetic Rates:</strong> Conversion rates may be calculated synthetically (e.g., Asset -> USD -> Target Currency) and are for estimation purposes only.</li>
        <li><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> We do not guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of these conversion rates. You should not use these estimates for active trading or financial auditing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Disclaimer: No Financial Advice</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The Service is for informational purposes only. We do not provide investment, legal, or tax advice.
    </div>
    <p>Any analytical outputs (e.g., "Net Return," "Unrealized P/L") are estimates based on the combination of your manual input and our conversion logic. We are not responsible for financial decisions made based on these calculations.</p>

    <h2>5. Account Security & Data Loss</h2>
    <p>Portfoyo uses <strong>internal anonymous authentication</strong>. We do not collect emails, passwords, or phone numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device-Bound Data:</strong> Your portfolio data is stored on our secure cloud servers but is cryptographically tied to the specific installation on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Loss upon Deletion:</strong> If you delete the Portfoyo app, factory reset your phone, or lose your device, <strong>your portfolio data will be permanently lost</strong>. Since the internal ID is deleted with the app, we have no way to recover your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Portfoyo offers a free tier and a paid "Premium" subscription, managed via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your device's Account Settings. We cannot cancel subscriptions or issue refunds directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Portfoyo, its developers, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including loss of data or funds) arising from your use of the Service or reliance on its analytics.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Turkey, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
