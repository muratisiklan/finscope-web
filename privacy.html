    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 04, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the Portfoyo mobile application (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use this Service. By using Portfoyo, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>

    <h2>2. Nature of the Service (Manual Tracking)</h2>
    <p>Portfoyo is strictly a <strong>manual portfolio analytics tool</strong>. It does not connect to brokerage accounts, banks, or live market data feeds. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data (tickers, prices, quantities, dates) is manually entered by you.</li>
        <li>The Service does not verify the accuracy of your input.</li>
        <li>You may use the Service for hypothetical scenarios ("mock data") or real tracking at your own discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclaimer: No Financial Advice</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The Service is for informational purposes only. We do not provide investment, legal, or tax advice.
    </div>
    <p>Any analytical outputs (e.g., "Net Return," "Unrealized P/L") are estimates based solely on the data you provide. We are not responsible for financial decisions made based on these calculations.</p>

    <h2>4. Account Security & Data Loss</h2>
    <p>Portfoyo uses <strong>internal anonymous authentication</strong>. We do not collect emails, passwords, or phone numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device-Bound Data:</strong> Your portfolio data is stored on our secure cloud servers but is cryptographically tied to the specific installation on your device. You do not have visibility of this internal ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Loss upon Deletion:</strong> If you delete the Portfoyo app, factory reset your phone, or lose your device, <strong>your portfolio data will be permanently lost</strong>. Since the internal ID is deleted with the app, we have no way to recover your account or link you to your previous data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Portfoyo offers a free tier and a paid "Premium" subscription, managed via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your device's Account Settings. We cannot cancel subscriptions or issue refunds directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Restoring Purchases:</strong> If you reinstall the app, you can use the "Restore Purchases" button to regain Premium status. However, this <strong>does not</strong> restore your portfolio data, as the data connection is permanently severed upon app deletion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Portfoyo, its developers, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including loss of data or funds) arising from your use of the Service or reliance on its analytics.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) at any time with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Turkey, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
