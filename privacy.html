    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>FinScope ("we," "our," or "us") operates a manual portfolio tracking application. This policy describes how we
        handle your data with a focus on privacy and data minimization.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide our analytical services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We collect a <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Email
                Address</strong> during registration. This is used solely to create your unique User ID in our database.
            We do not verify this email or use it for marketing.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> We store the investment transaction data (asset names, prices, quantities,
            dates) that you <em>manually enter</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous crash reports or performance metrics to fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No Market Data or Banking APIs</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> connect to any third-party banking APIs or market data providers. We do not have
        access to your actual bank accounts or brokerage statements. All financial data in the app is user-generated.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To calculate and display portfolio analytics (e.g., Net Worth, Asset Allocation).</li>
        <li>To sync your manual entries across your devices.</li>
        <li>To validate your Premium subscription status via RevenueCat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We share data with the following trusted partners solely for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Processes subscription receipts. We send an anonymous User ID to link your
            purchase to your account. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">Read Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Expo:</strong> Provides the app infrastructure. <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Read Policy</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as your account is active. You have the right to delete your account at any time:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <strong>Profile > Delete Account</strong> within the app.</li>
        <li>This action <strong>permanently wipes</strong> your username, email, and all transaction data from our
            servers immediately. This cannot be undone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Your password is hashed (encrypted) before storage. We use SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission. However,
        since we do not verify emails, we cannot recover accounts if credentials are lost.</p>

    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of
        your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than
        those from your jurisdiction. By using the Service, you consent to this transfer.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights (KVKK & GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Under applicable data protection laws (including KVKK and GDPR), you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request the correction of inaccurate data.</li>
        <li>Request the deletion of your account and data (Right to be Forgotten).</li>
        <li>Object to the processing of your data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, simply use the "Delete Account" feature in the app or contact us.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally
        identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that
        your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.</p>
