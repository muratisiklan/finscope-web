    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>FinScope ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by FinScope.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide our services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect your Username and Email Address to secure your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> You manually input investment data (tickers, quantities, prices). This data is stored securely on our servers to provide you with portfolio analytics across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous logs regarding app performance and crash reports to improve stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. However, we use trusted third-party services to operate the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and purchase history. They process transaction receipts but do not have access to your detailed financial portfolio. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">Read their Privacy Policy.</a></li>
        <li><strong>Expo:</strong> We use Expo for app infrastructure and over-the-air updates. <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Read their Privacy Policy.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your password is hashed (encrypted) before being stored in our database. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights (Account Deletion)</h2>
    <p>You have the right to delete your account and all associated data at any time. You can perform this action directly within the app via the <strong>Profile &gt; Delete Account</strong> menu. Upon deletion, your data is permanently removed from our servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
