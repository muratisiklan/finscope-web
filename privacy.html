    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 04, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Portfoyo ("we," "our," or "us") operates a privacy-focused manual portfolio tracking application. This policy describes how we handle your data with a strict focus on anonymity and data minimization.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We adhere to the principle of <strong>Data Minimization</strong>. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or password.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Identity:</strong> When you install the app, we generate a random unique identifier (UUID) internally. This ID is used to sync your data but is not visible to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> We store the investment transaction data (asset names, prices, quantities, dates) you manually enter on our secure cloud servers. This data is associated <em>only</em> with your internal Anonymous ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous crash reports or standard performance metrics (via Expo) to improve app stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. No Market Data or Banking APIs</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> connect to any third-party banking APIs (like Plaid) or live market data feeds. We do not have access to your actual bank accounts, brokerage statements, or identity.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To store and sync your portfolio data securely so you can access it via the app.</li>
        <li>To calculate analytics (e.g., Net Worth, Asset Allocation) associated with your anonymous ID.</li>
        <li>To validate your Premium subscription status via RevenueCat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We share minimal data with the following trusted partners solely for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Processes subscription receipts. We send your anonymous User ID to link your purchase to your app instance. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">Read Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Expo:</strong> Provides the underlying app infrastructure and over-the-air updates. <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Read Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your anonymous data on our servers for as long as the app is installed on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion via App Removal:</strong> If you uninstall the application, the internal key required to access your data is destroyed. Consequently, your data becomes permanently inaccessible and is treated as deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Explicit Deletion:</strong> You can explicitly delete your account at any time via <strong>Profile > Delete Account</strong>. This action permanently wipes your Anonymous ID and all associated transaction data from our servers immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmission. Since we do not store passwords or emails, there are no credentials to be stolen. However, because access to your data depends on the installation on your device, you are responsible for keeping your physical device secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights (KVKK & GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Under applicable data protection laws (including KVKK and GDPR), you have rights regarding your data. However, because we do not collect personal identifiers and the Anonymous ID is not visible to you, <strong>we cannot verify your identity</strong> outside of the app application.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To exercise your <strong>Right to Erasure</strong> or <strong>Right to Access</strong>, you must use the tools provided directly within the application (such as the "Delete Account" button). We cannot process these requests via email as we have no way to locate your specific data.</li>
    </ul>
